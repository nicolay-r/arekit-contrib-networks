> **NOTE:** This code base is a  **contrib** part from the [AREkit-0.25.0 release](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/releases/tag/v0.25.0-rc).

This project represent code part that has been related to 
**serialization of data** necessary for ðŸ§ª**experiments with neural networks** ðŸ¤– in the domain of 
**attitudes and relation extraction**.
This project is powered by [AREkit pipelines](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit).

In particular, the most crucial part of this project is 
* `NetworksInputSerializerPipelineItem` -- represent a pipeline element for handy data serialization that involves:
    * Embedding preparation;
    * Tokenization;
    * Annotation of entities;
    * Annotation of subject-object pairs.

## Third-party projects

The projects that depend on the related source code but not directly depends on from the PyPI are: 
* ### [arekit-ss](https://github.com/nicolay-r/arekit-ss): supports serialization for neural networks from various sources
* ### [AREnets](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREnets): supports traning launching using Tensorflow API
